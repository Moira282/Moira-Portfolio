# Hi my name is Moira! ðŸ‘‹ 


Iâ€™m a **neuropsychologist** with a passion for **data analytics.** My background in psychology has given me a strong foundation in research, statistics, and problem-solving skills.

Iâ€™m proficient in **SPSS** for statistical analysis and have experience developing projects in **SQL** to organize and extract insights from databases. I also work with **Python** and **R** for data analysis, visualization, and automation. Additionally, I have **advanced skills in Excel and Google Sheets**, using them for data processing, dashboards, and complex formulas.

I thrive on turning raw data into meaningful insights, whether itâ€™s for research, business, or learning and development. If you're looking for someone who bridges the gap between human behavior and data-driven decision-making, letâ€™s connect!
