# 📊 Burnout in University Employed Students  
**Development and Validation of a Measurement Scale**  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
University students who work part-time or full-time often face **high stress levels**, leading to **Burnout Syndrome**—a condition characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced performance.  

Existing burnout measurement tools (e.g., Maslach Burnout Inventory) do not specifically address this **dual-role population**. This project aimed to **develop and validate a targeted burnout scale** for student workers.  

## 🎯 Research Question  
How can we create a **reliable and valid instrument** to measure burnout in university students who also work?

## 🛠 Methodology  
Followed a **structured psychometric approach** to develop a new measurement scale:  

### **1️⃣ Scale Development**  
- **Literature Review** → Identified gaps in existing burnout scales.  
- **Indicator Selection** → Focused on:  
  - **Emotional Exhaustion** (Individuals feel emotionally drained and overwhelmed.)  
  - **Depersonalization** (Negative, cynical, and impersonal attitudes towards others, leading to emotional detachment.)
  - **Reduced Work Performance** (Decreased competence and self-evaluation, particularly in professional or academic tasks.)  
- **Survey Design** → Created **17 initial items** and tested for clarity and validity.  

### **2️⃣ Data Collection**  
- **Survey Sample** → 105 university students (ages 18-25) with part-time/full-time jobs.  
- **Survey Tool** → Microsoft Forms (online questionnaire).  

### **3️⃣ Statistical Analysis & Refinement**  
- **Cronbach’s Alpha**:  
  - Initial scale reliability: **0.64 (weak/questionable)**.  
  - Factor analysis suggested eliminating weakly correlated items.

  - After refinement: **0.78 (acceptable)**.

- **Factor Analysis (PCA)**:  
  - Confirmed a **2-factor structure** (Reduced Work Performance & Depersonalization).
  - During the statistical analysis, the **Emotional Exhaustion was eliminated** due to low reliability and poor correlation with the overall burnout construct.

- **External Validation**:  
  - Compared with **Barraza’s Burnout Scale** → **r = 0.8 (high correlation)**.

## 🔍 Results & Key Findings  
✔️ **Final Scale** → **6 items**, measuring two key dimensions:  
   1. **Work Performance**  
   2. **Depersonalization**  

✔️ **Improved reliability** (α = **0.78**).  

✔️ **Confirmed burnout risk factors** in student workers:  
   - Decreased concentration and productivity.  
   - Emotional detachment and negative self-perception.

✔️ **Practical Implications**:  
   - Provides a **targeted tool** for measuring burnout in working students.  
   - Can help universities and workplaces **develop better interventions**.
